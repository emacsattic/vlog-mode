* About vlog-mode ------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of vlog-mode is to build a FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE verilog IDE. Everybody
is welcom to make suggestions, submit feature requests or become part of the
vlog-mode team. No single person, group or organization controls the vlog-mode
codes.

* TODOs ----------------------------------------------------------------------
** AUTO features, especially auto sensitive list WITHOUT /*AUTO_SENSE*/
   directive comments.

** Module ports detection and auto module instantiation; Hierarchical module
   ports listing and hinting, something like "intellisense" or better.

** A "tuner" for indentation and alignment settings. Ideas are needed.

** Signal width detection using tooltip around the cursor, not the mouse.

** Code folding with hs-minor-mode.

** XEmacs compatability tests.

* Feature list ---------------------------------------------------------------
** Colorful syntax highlight, easy-to-use keywords customization.
*** module instantiation fontification.
*** begin/fork block identifiers fontification.
*** special comments fontification. For example "//TODO" or "// psl",etc.
    check variable vlog-mode-keywordset-docs before you add your own doc
    keywords.

** Fully configurable code indentation and alignment. Read README for more.

** Convenient typing assistants.
*** do indentation automatically after you type begin, fork, end, join,
    case[xz] and endcase. Because these words may vary the indentation of
    current line.
*** automatically insert matching "end"("join") for "begin"("fork") when you
    start a new line. Controlled by `vlog-mode-auto-end-block'.
*** auto-indent every new line by default.
*** automatic expansion in signal width declaration. That is, after you type a
    "reg 4", and then a space, Emacs will expand it into "reg [3:1]"
    automatically. This feature dose NOT support macros.
*** "Hungry" backward deletion. Bind to [C-backspace] by default.

** Signal width detection: show signal's width in echo area. Move the cursor
   onto a signal, and then press F1.

** Smart skeletons. e.g. auto clock signal insertion for edge-sensitive always
   blocks.
*** Type C-c C-c C-a to insert an edge sensitive always block.  Emacs will
    detect previous codes for clock and reset signals and insert them
    automatically.
*** Type C-c C-c a to insert a combinative sensitive always block.
*** Type C-c C-h to insert a header for current file.

** Smart signals. e.g. detect main signal in current always block.
*** Type M-s inside an always block to insert the "target signal".  Target
    signal is the signal for which this block is INTENDED.  This feature is
    based on the suppose that most signals are described seperately in
    seperate always blocks and, in most always blocks, there's only one
    left signal.
